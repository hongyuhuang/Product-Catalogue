# Product-Catalogue
The objective of the project was to create a GUI in Java that could be used as a product catalogue manager. This included functionality such as adding, viewing, editing, searching and deleting products.

A constraint in this project was that it's meant to be more of proof of concept rather than a polished application. It's lacking things such as input validation and connection to a database. It just purely meets the requirements of the assignment.

This project can be run by downloading the files and running the MainMenu.java file.

Some improvements that could be made would be some test cases for the DAO and also some tests for the actual GUI itself taking inputs.
